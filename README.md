# hangman-sinatra

This was written in ruby with the help of the sinatra framework. This project was part of The Odin Project curriculum. I found this
project to be challanging, but very do-able. Understanding routes was vital to completing this project. This project was a continuation
of the hangman project written for the command-line in ruby.
